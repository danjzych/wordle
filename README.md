# React Wordle

This Wordle clone was built using React, React Transition Group, and react-chartjs-2. I built this project as a way to practice React application, and because I love Wordle.

This Wordle app is live [here](http://wordle.danielzych.com/).

## Running The App

To run this Wordle app yourself, follow these simple steps:

1. Download repository
2. run `npm install` within /wordle
3. run `npm start` within /wordle

## Notable Features

In addition to basic Wordle game functionality, this application has:

- User can **intuitively use keyboard** to make their guess. There is no input field, just type!
- **Fully functional clickable keyboard**. Can toggle between both seemlessly
- User's **game record stored in local storage** and used to generate **insights on "statistics" tab**

### Upcoming Features and Additions

I have not been able to add all features I wanted to add to this app as of 11/03/2023. I plan to iterate on this project continually and rapidly. Expect the following in the coming weeks:

- **Testing**!
- More **Responsive layout** and **mobile layout** with media queries
- **Improved animations**, such as flipping tiles when a guess is submitted
- **Maintaining game state in local storage** so that user can come back to a particular Wordle throught the day
- Implement backend that provides all users with the **same Wordle every 24hrs**
- **TypeScript refactor**
