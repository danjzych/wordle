# React Wordle

This Wordle clone was built using React, React Transition Group, and react-chartjs-2. I built this project as a way to practice React application, and because I love Wordle.

## Running The App

To run this Wordle app yourself, follow these simple steps:

1. Download repository
2. run `npm install` within /wordle
3. run `npm start` within /wordle

## Notable Features

In addition to basic Wordle game functionality, this application has:

- User can _intuitively use keyboard_ to make their guess. There is no input field, just type!
- _Fully functional clickable keyboard_. Can toggle between both seemlessly
- User's _game record stored in local storage_ and used to generate _insights on "statistics" tab_

### Upcoming Features and Additions

I have not been able to add all features I wanted to add to this app as of 11/03/2023. I plan to iterate on this project continually and rapidly. Expect the following in the coming weeks:

- _Testing_!
- More _Responsive layout_ and _mobile layout_ with media queries
- _Improved animations_, such as flipping tiles when a guess is submitted
- _Maintaining game state in local storage_ so that user can come back to a particular Wordle throught the day
- Implement backend that provides all users with the _same Wordle every 24hrs_
- _TypeScript refactor_
